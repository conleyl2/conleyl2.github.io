    <H2>About Me</H2>

        <P>I am an experienced Analytics Consultant with over four years of experience in data analysis. Possessing a solid knack for the analytic disciplines, I utilized online and professional resources to become a skilled asset to my company. I excel in problem solving and making quality of life improvements in the systems I have managed. I am experienced in presenting to executive staff on a regular basis. When joining a team, I focus on improving as much as possible to further enhance my skills. I continually achieve this with my current and past teams in the retirement and mortgage industries while relentlessly pursuing improvement.</P>
